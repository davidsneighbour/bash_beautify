# Bash beautify

A **simple** extension that just works for shell script formatting based on [Paul Lutus's - Bash Script Beautifier](https://arachnoid.com/python/beautify_bash_program.html), The underlying script doesn't do any syntax processing, Hence **simple**. It's lightweight and just needs python

It'll work with the default format keyboard binding when you edit a `.sh` file.

* If you need error checking consider installing also [ShellCheck](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timonwong.shellcheck).

* If you want a more extensive formatter cehck out [shell-format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foxundermoon.shell-format) it requires
`golang` and `shfmt` installed
